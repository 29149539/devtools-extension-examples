    <p>This example extension shows how to use <code>Model View Controller</code> (MVC) pattern
       in context of an extension for Firefox DevTools. It also demonstrates how to
       connect all components of the pattern together through events.</p>
    <p>Use case:
    <ol>
    <li>Clicking on the button below generates standard click event handled
    by this <code>View</code> (myView.html).</li>
    <li>The event is forwarded throug a message manager to <code>Controller</code>
    living in the chrome scope (myPanel.js) together with current time [ms] as a payload.</li>
    <li>When the time arrives to the Controller it's further passed to <code>Model</code>
    (myExtension.js, also living in the chrome scope) to nicely format it.</li>
    <li>The formatted string is sent back to this View (through
    message manager to the content scope and finally as DOM event to the View)</li>
    </ol>
